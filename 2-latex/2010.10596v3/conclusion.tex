\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper, we collected and reviewed \papers papers which proposed various algorithmic solutions to finding counterfactual explanations for the decisions produced by automated systems, specifically automated by machine learning. 
Evaluating all the papers on the same rubric helps in quickly understanding the peculiarities of different approaches and the advantages, and disadvantages of each of them, which can also help organizations choose the algorithm best suited to their application constraints. 
This has also helped us readily identify the gaps, which will be beneficial to researchers scouring for open problems in this space and quickly sifting the large body of literature. 
We hope this paper can also be the starting point for people wanting to get an introduction to the broad area of counterfactual explanations and guide them to proper resources for things they might be interested in. \\
